# TesaHealth

TesaHealth is my Final Degree Project (TFG). It is a web application that collects patient-reported symptoms and, through externally orchestrated AI tools, generates two main outputs: a MIR-style clinical vignette and a set of differential diagnoses with an associated urgency level.

On the clinician side, there is a dedicated portal where multiple professionals can review each case independently (blindly) and submit their assessments. The different responses for the same case are then aggregated and evaluated, and a final consensus option is produced and sent back to the patient.

For the patient, the final output is meant to be a safe orientation, not a replacement for a real consultation. It includes the proposed diagnosis, the urgency level, a recommended care pathway, and a short explanation of how that conclusion was reached.

The application is designed with a future scenario in mind where it could be integrated into a diagnostic kiosk with medical devices connected to it, so the TesaHealth framework would not only receive symptoms (as in this prototype) but also real clinical data. In that setting, the kiosk would include a patient login verified with an official ID, and clinicians from anywhere in the world could answer cases—optionally receiving monetary rewards to acknowledge their contribution.

Overall, the goal of this approach is to help optimize the health system by reducing waiting lists, enabling pre-assessment that stratifies urgency, improving interoperability and person-centred care (PCC), and increasing health literacy. It combines clinical AI with specialized human oversight to deliver more reliable and trustworthy results.
